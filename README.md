The MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture, a popular approach in Android development, emphasizes clean code and a clear separation of concerns by dividing the application into three main components: Model, View, and Intent. This unidirectional data flow and distinct roles contribute to easier understanding, building, and maintenance of MVI apps.
